📢 **Welcome to my project**:
A complete **English-to-Urdu Translation** model powered by **RNN and LSTM** architectures! 🌍 This project bridges language barriers by implementing advanced **NLP concepts** to perform **many-to-many translations** with **sequence models**.

---

## 🔍 **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** to translate sentences from **English** to **Urdu**. The model overcomes the challenges of traditional RNNs, such as **vanishing gradients**, by leveraging **LSTM's memory cells** for better context retention.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Libraries Used**
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training RNN/LSTM models.  
- **NLTK**: For BLEU score evaluation.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and testing.  
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing.

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Tokenized and padded **English-Urdu parallel corpus**.
   - Splitting data into **training and testing sets**.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Embedding Layer**: Converts words to dense vectors.
   - **LSTM Layer**: Processes the sequence with long-term dependencies.
   - **Many-to-Many Architecture**: Ensures each word in the input sequence has a corresponding output word.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - **BLEU Score**: Measures the translation quality.
   - **Accuracy**: Evaluates model performance on the test set.

---

## 📈 **Project Results**
- **LSTM outperformed RNN** by achieving **higher BLEU scores**.
- The model provided **better context retention** in complex sentences.  
- Successfully translated test sentences such as:
   - **Input**: "Good morning"  
   - **Output**: "صبح بخیر"

## 📝 **Sample Code Snippet**

```python
# Example: Generating Urdu translation for input text
input_text = "Good morning"
input_seq = eng_tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([input_text])
input_padded = pad_sequences(input_seq, maxlen=max_len, padding='post')

# Generate prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_padded)
predicted_seq = np.argmax(prediction, axis=-1)
translated_text = urdu_tokenizer.sequences_to_texts(predicted_seq)
print(f"Translated Text: {translated_text[0]}")
```
